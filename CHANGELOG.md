# Changelog

All notable changes to ViralMint will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Tools page** — 18 single-purpose utilities (captions, reframe, audio-enhance, watermark, remove-silence, merge-clips, GIF, speed, trim, subtitles, auto-zoom, transform, music-visualizer, voice-over via Edge TTS, plus AI helpers: translate, metadata, hook-analysis, auto-chapters). The 13 ffmpeg/Whisper tools run fully locally with no API key; the AI helpers and the ✨ Enhance-prompt button use the user's own key (BYOK). Each tool has an inline result preview. New `/api/tools/*` router + `backend/core/tool_runners.py`. (AI media generators — image/music/video — are intentionally not in the OSS build.)
- **Proactive assistant** — the planner now reads live pipeline state (downloaded-not-clipped, generated-not-uploaded, scouted-not-downloaded) and surfaces the single highest-value next step. Backed by behavior-event instrumentation so the personalization engine learns from every completed job.

### Fixed
- Library self-heals — generated-video rows whose rendered file has been deleted are now pruned on list, so dead/broken tiles no longer linger.

### Security
- Bump `cryptography` to `>=46.0.6,<47` — closes PYSEC-2026-35, GHSA-h4gh-qq45-vh27, CVE-2024-12797, CVE-2026-26007 (4 CVEs in the 43.x line).
- Bump `Pillow` to `>=12.2.0,<13.0` — closes CVE-2026-25990, 40192, 42308, 42309, 42310, 42311 (6 OOB / hang / memory-corruption issues affecting the thumbnail and ffmpeg image-processing paths). The `Image.ANTIALIAS` / `BICUBIC` monkeypatch in `backend/main.py` continues to work against Pillow 12.x.

### Changed
- Bump `openai` floor from `1.55` to `1.109.1` (still `<2.0`).
- Bump `playwright` floor from `1.58` to `1.59`.
- Bump 12 grouped Python minor/patch deps (dependabot `python-minor-patch` group).
- Bump `@mui/icons-material` 7.3.9→7.3.11, `axios`, `lucide-react` (dependabot `js-minor-patch` group).
- Bump CI actions — `actions/checkout` v4→v6 plus `setup-python`, `setup-node`, `codeql-action` (dependabot `ci-actions` group).

### Docs
- README — added an above-the-fold "Two ways to use ViralMint" callout clarifying the OSS variant (BYOK, Uploader agent, AGPL-3.0) vs the hosted SaaS at viralmint.net (prepaid credits, no auto-upload, closed-source). Helps new visitors pick the right variant without scrolling.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-07

### Added
- **OpenRouter as a third BYOK provider** — alongside Anthropic and OpenAI direct, a single OpenRouter API key now opens access to 300+ models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Mixtral, Llama, etc.) through one credential. Configurable via `.env` or per-user in Settings → API Keys. See `backend/core/ai_provider.py`.

### Changed
- **Dependabot config** — minor/patch dependency updates are now batched into three groups (`python-minor-patch`, `js-minor-patch`, `ci-actions`) instead of arriving one PR at a time. Major framework versions (FastAPI / React / Pillow majors etc.) stay outside the groups so they always get explicit review.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-07

Initial open-source release.

### Added
- **Scout** — multi-platform trend discovery across YouTube, TikTok, Douyin, and Google Trends, with virality scoring and 3×–20× channel-baseline outlier detection.
- **Analyze** — local Whisper transcription plus AI insight extraction (hook, structure, tone, retention risks) per downloaded video.
- **Generate** — full pipeline: AI script → TTS voice → Pexels stock footage → word-by-word ASS captions → background music → finished mp4.
- **Clip Studio** — extract publishable 30–60s shorts from a long-form source; AI picks the best moments and burns captions.
- **Publish** — direct upload to YouTube (OAuth) and TikTok (OAuth or session cookie) with platform-optimized titles, descriptions, tags, and thumbnails.
- **Chat** — streaming WebSocket chat with the planner agent; action blocks dispatch background jobs (scout / download / analyze / generate / upload).
- **Messaging** — two-way chat over Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, and Slack — same agent, different transport.
- **BYOK** — Anthropic / OpenAI / YouTube / Pexels / TikHub keys settable per-user in the UI or via `.env`. Per-user keys are AES-256 encrypted at rest.
- **Edge TTS** — 400+ free voices in 70+ languages; the default voiceover provider.
- **Universal downloader** — yt-dlp under the hood (1000+ sites supported).
- 92-test pytest suite covering crypto, scout scoring, captions, exception handling, HTTP utilities, and the async task runner.
- AGPL-3.0 license, SPDX headers on every Python source file.

### Security
- API binds to `127.0.0.1` (loopback) by default. Users who want LAN access can set `HOST=0.0.0.0` in `.env` knowingly.
- All third-party credentials encrypted with Fernet (AES-256) before being written to SQLite.
- No telemetry. No analytics. No cloud backend in the middle — keys go directly from your machine to the provider.
